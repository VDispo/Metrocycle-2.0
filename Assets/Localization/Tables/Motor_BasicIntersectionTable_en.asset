    m_Localized: Let's learn how to use the intersection correctly. Note that the
      max speed in intersections is 20kph. First, Try turning RIGHT on the next intersection.

      turn LEFT.

    m_Localized: When turning left, prefer merging on the inner lane to minimize
      possible crashes (e.g. with other vehicles merging via a left turn). Next,
      return to the Intersection and perform a U-TURN carefully.

    m_Localized: Similar to Right turns, prefer U-turning on the inner lane. Position
      yourself in the correct lane in advance. Finally, return to the intersection
      and go straight through it.
